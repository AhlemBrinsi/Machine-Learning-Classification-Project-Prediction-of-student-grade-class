# Machine Learning Classification project

You are provided with a dataset of 2,392 high school students that includes information on StudentID, Age, Gender, Ethnicity, Parental Education, Study Time Weekly, Absences, buildTutoring, Parental Support, Extracurricular activities, GPA, and the target variable GradeClass, which is a numerical classification of student performance (e.g., 1, 2, etc.)

Your goal is to predict the GradeClass of a student using the other features in the dataset by using two machine learning models: k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree classifiers.
